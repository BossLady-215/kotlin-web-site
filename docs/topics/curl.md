[//]: # (title: Creating an app using C Interop and libcurl â€“ tutorial)

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a simple HTTP command-line client that can run natively on multiple
platforms using Kotlin/Native and the `libcurl` library.

The output will be an executable command-line application that allows making simple HTTP GET requests.

While it is possible to use the command line, either directly or by combining it with a script file (such as a `.sh` or
a `.bat` file), this approach doesn't scale well for big projects with hundreds of files and libraries. It is then
better to use the Kotlin/Native compiler with a build system, as it helps to download and cache the Kotlin/Native
compiler binaries and libraries with transitive dependencies and run the compiler and tests. Kotlin/Native can use the
[Gradle](https://gradle.org) build system through the [kotlin-multiplatform](mpp-discover-project.md#multiplatform-plugin)
plugin.

## Create a Kotlin/Native project

1. Select **File | New | Project**.
2. In the panel on the left, select **Kotlin | Native Application**.
3. Specify the name and select the folder where you'll save your application.

3. Click **Next** and then **Finish**.

IDEA will create a new project with some files and folders to get you started. It's important to understand that
an application written in Kotlin/Native can target different platforms if the code does not have platform-specific
requirements. Your code is placed in a folder named `NativeMain` with its corresponding `NativeTest`. For this tutorial,
keep the folder structure as is.

Along with your new project, a `build.gradle` file is generated. Check it out:

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("multiplatform") version "%kotlinVersion%"
}

group = "me.user"
version = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

repositories {
    mavenCentral()

kotlin {
    val hostOs = System.getProperty("os.name")
    val isMingwX64 = hostOs.startsWith("Windows")
    val nativeTarget = when {
        hostOs == "Mac OS X" -> macosX64("native")
        hostOs == "Linux" -> linuxX64("native")
        isMingwX64 -> mingwX64("native")
        else -> throw GradleException("Host OS is not supported in Kotlin/Native.")
    }

    nativeTarget.apply {

            else if (isMingwX64) nativeTarget = mingwX64("native")
            else throw new FileNotFoundException("Host OS is not supported in Kotlin/Native.")

    nativeTarget.with {

* Targets are defined using `macOSX64`, `linuxX64`, and `mingwX64` for macOS, Linux, and Windows. For a complete
  list of supported platforms, see the [Kotlin Native overview](native-overview.md#target-platforms).
* The entry itself defines a series of properties to indicate how the binary is generated and the entry
  point of the applications. These can be left as default values.
* The C interoperability is configured as an additional step of the build. By default, all the symbols from C are
  imported to the `interop` package; you may want to import the whole package in `.kt` files. Check out the [kotlin-multiplatform](mpp-discover-project.md#multiplatform-plugin)
  plugin documentation to learn about all the different ways you could configure it.

## Create the definition file

When writing native applications, you often need access to certain functionality that is not included in the Kotlin
standard library, such as making HTTP requests, reading and writing from disk, and so on.

Kotlin/Native helps consume standard C libraries, opening up an entire ecosystem of functionality that exists
for pretty much anything you may need. Kotlin/Native is already shipped with a set of prebuilt [platform libraries](native-platform-libs.md),
which provide some additional common functionality to the standard library.

An ideal scenario for interop is to call C functions as if you are calling Kotlin functions, following the same
signature and conventions. This is when the `cinterop` tool comes in handy. It takes a C library and generates the
corresponding Kotlin bindings, allowing us to use the library as if it were Kotlin code.

To generate these bindings, let's create a library definition `.def` file that contains some information about
the necessary headers. In our app, you'll need the `libcurl` library to make some HTTP calls. To create a
definition file:

1. Select the `src` folder and go to **File | New | Directory**.
2. Name new directory **nativeInterop/cinterop**. This is the default convention for header file locations, though it can
   be overridden in the `build.gradle` file if you use a different location.
3. Select this new subfolder and go to **File | New | File**.
4. Name the new file `libcurl.def`.
5. Copy and paste the following contents:

```c
headers = curl/curl.h
headerFilter = curl/*

compilerOpts.linux = -I/usr/include -I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu
linkerOpts.osx = -L/opt/local/lib -L/usr/local/opt/curl/lib -lcurl
linkerOpts.linux = -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -lcurl
```

* The first entry is `headers`, which is the list of header files for which we want to generate Kotlin stubs. We can add
  multiple files to this entry, separating each with a `\` on a new line. In our case, we only want `curl.h`.
  The files we are referencing need to be relative to the folder where the definition file is or be available on the
  system path (in our case, it's `/usr/include/curl`).
* The second line is the `headerFilter`. It shows what exactly is included. In C, all the headers are also included when
  one file references another one with the `#include` directive. Sometimes it's not necessary, and we can add this
  parameter [using glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) to fine-tune things.
  Note that `headerFilter` is an optional argument and is mostly only used when the library is being installed as a system
  library. You don't want to fetch external dependencies (such as system `stdint.h` header) into the interop library.
  It may be important to optimize the library size and fix potential conflicts between the system and the Kotlin/Native
  provided compilation environment.
* The next lines are about providing linker and compiler options, which can vary depending on different target
  platforms. In our case, we are defining it for macOS (the `.osx` suffix) and Linux (the `.linux` suffix). Parameters
  without a suffix are also possible (for example, `linkerOpts=`) and applied to all platforms.

The convention is that each library gets its definition file, usually with the same name as the library. For more
information on all the options available to `cinterop`, see [the Interop section](native-c-interop.md).

> You need to have the `curl` library binaries on your system to make the sample work. On macOS and Linux, it is usually
> included. On Windows, you can build it from [sources](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) (you'll need Visual Studio or
> Windows SDK Commandline tools), for more details, see the [related blog post](https://jonnyzzz.com/blog/2018/10/29/kn-libcurl-windows/).
> Alternatively, you may also want to consider a [MinGW/MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) `curl` binary.

## Add interoperability to the build process

To use header files, let's make sure they are generated as a part of the build process. For this, add the following
entry to the `build.gradle` file:

<tabs>

```kotlin
nativeTarget.apply {
    compilations.main { // NL
        cinterops {     // NL
            libcurl     // NL
        }               // NL
    }                   // NL
        binaries {
            executable { 
                entryPoint = "main"
    }
  }
}
    
```      

```groovy
nativeTarget.with {
    compilations.main { // NL
        cinterops {     // NL
            libcurl     // NL
        }               // NL
    }                   // NL
    binaries {
        executable {
            entryPoint = 'main'
        }
    }
}
```

</tabs>

The new lines are marked with `// NL`. First, `cinterops` is added, and then an entry for each `def` file. By default,
the name of the file is used. You can override this with additional parameters:

```groovy
libcurl {
    defFile project.file("libcurl.def")
    packageName 'com.jetbrains.handson.http'
    compilerOpts '-I/path'
    includeDirs.allHeaders("path")
}
```

See the [Interoperability with C](native-c-interop.md) section for more details on the available options.

## Write the application code

Now you have the library and the corresponding Kotlin stubs and can consume them from your application. To keep things
simple, in this tutorial, you will convert one of the simplest `libcurl` examples over to Kotlin.

The code in question is from the [simple](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/simple.html) example.
In the `src/nativeMain/kotlin/` folder, copy and paste the following code into the `Main.kt` file:

```kotlin
import kotlinx.cinterop.*
import libcurl.*

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val curl = curl_easy_init()
    if (curl != null) {
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com")
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1L)
        val res = curl_easy_perform(curl)
        if (res != CURLE_OK) {
            println("curl_easy_perform() failed ${curl_easy_strerror(res)?.toKString()}")
        }
        curl_easy_cleanup(curl)
    }
}
```

As you can see, you've eliminated the explicit variable declarations in the Kotlin version, but everything else is pretty
much the same as the C version. All the calls you'd expect in the `libcurl` library are available in the Kotlin equivalent.

Note that for this tutorial, we've done a line-by-line literal translation. You could also write this in a more Kotlin
idiomatic way.

## Build and run the application

The next step is to compile the application. We already covered the basics of compiling a Kotlin/Native application from
the command line in the [corresponding tutorial](native-command-line-compiler.md) tutorial. The only difference in this
case is that the `cinterop` generated part is implicitly included into the build. Call the following command:

```bash
./gradlew runDebugExecutableNative
```

If there are no errors during compilation, run the build from your IDE. You should see contents of the site `https://example.com`:

![output](native-output.png)

You see the actual output because the call `curl_easy_perform` prints the result to the standard output. You could hide
this using `curl_easy_setopt`.

## Whatâ€™s next?

For a complete example of using the `libcurl`, see the [libcurl sample of the Kotlin/Native project](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/tree/master/kotlin-native/samples/libcurl)
that shows how to abstract the code into Kotlin classes as well as display headers. It also demonstrates how to make
the steps easier by combining them into a shell script or Gradle build.
